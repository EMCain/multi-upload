# multi-upload
A jQuery plugin to upload and edit multiple files.

Uses jQuery, Bootstrap for styling, and [https://github.com/fengyuanchen](Fengyuan Chen's Cropper) for image editing.

The current version is 1.0. Dependency versions in current iteration of project (as of 12 June 2016):
* jQuery v3.1.1
* Bootstrap v3.3.6
* Cropper v2.3.2

Dependency files are contained in `assets`. 

This is a work in progress. I'm developing it for a specific project and will focus on meeting the needs of that specific project first: a desktop-styled site that allows for editing images and deleting any type of uploaded file, but does not allow for renaming any files. I'm going to focus on functionality and only develop stylesheets as needed to use the plugin. I'll add on other features for a wider range of applications after that; feel free to submit an issue or pull request if you have an idea you think would improve the plugin.
